# TwosTango
A collaborative project between Kian and I.

*--Project Brief--*
This will be a rogue-like/lite based on the classic arcade game "Snake". 
It will operate similar to recent rogue-likes such as: Binding of Isaac; Risk of Rain and Nuclear Throne
by including pick-ups, various enemies and maps.

Mostly likely it will be made using the Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition as well as MonoGame.

This is just a side project to work on while we are studing to get some experience with paired development 
and development in the style of GitHub.
